# HTML


- HTML basics and Semantics

Firstly HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language which is the standard for creating web pages and it structures the Web page 
and it consists of a series of elements called tags.




# JavaScript 

JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactiv ewhich allows the devlopers to make to user experice more intutive therefore saves the user's time. in HTML the <script> tag is used to define a user side script through (JavaScript) this **<script>** might contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the source <src> attribute.

## Control flow 
 
  Is the order in which the computer executes statements in the code Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
 ## Loops and iteration  

A Loop  can be explained as telling the computer to keep processing the equation untill an answar is found and there are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing they repeat an action some number of times.


The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

## Operators
### AND ** (AND &)**  
The logical AND operator is evaluated left to right, it is tested for possible short-circuit evaluation using the following rule:

(some falsy expression) && expression is short-circuit evaluated to the falsy expression;

Short circuit means that the expression part above is not evaluated, hence any side effects of doing so do not take effect example if expression is a function call, the calling never takes place

The logical AND assignment (x &&= y) operator only assigns if x is truthy.


x &&= y


## OR   **(or ||)**

**(	x ||= y)**

 
The logical OR operator short-circuits: the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand doesnâ€™t already determine the result.

Logical OR assignment short-circuits as well, meaning it only performs an assignment if the logical operation would evaluate the right-hand side

The logical OR assignment (x ||= y) operator only assigns if x is falsy

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS allows you to make great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood
Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS



### External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

### Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

### Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. to use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
