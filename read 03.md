- wireframing


wireframing is a practice that web designers do to plan out the user interaction with the site which includes where the menus or the images will be on site. 


- HTML basics and Semantics


Firstly HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language which is the standard for creating web pages and it structures the Web page 
and it consists of a series of elements called tags.

- Semantics


Semantics is the defines information about  each element in a document through proper selection of markup elements and to maintain complete separation between the markup and the visual presentation of the elements contained in the document.

Firstly it makes HTML much easier to read therefore easier to edit .
Overall semantic elements leads to more consistent code.
