# - What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.

# - Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

The client will try to establish a WebSocket connection if possible, and will fall back on HTTP long polling if not.

# - What happens when a client emits an event?
The event gets passed to the server through websockets. Its a tcp connection from the browser to the server. The connection is full duplex meaning the server can send real time data to the client and vise versa.

# - What happens when a server emits an event?

Socket.io is (as far as I can tell) a robust server->client->server event handler, and is really great at that. However I was looking to handle some events within the app itself. I found what I was here in NodeJs' documentation.




# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

 - Socket
 one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.
 - Web Socket
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP.

 - Socket.io
 Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.



 - Server
 The Server instance (often called io in the code examples) has a few attributes that may be of use in your application.

## Rooms and Namespaces




This is what namespaces and rooms have in common  involved a complete rewrite, so things might have changed):

Both namespaces (io.of('/nsp')) and rooms (socket.join('room')) are created on the server side
Multiple namespaces and multiple rooms share the same (WebSocket) connection
The server will transmit messages over the wire only to those clients that connected to / joined a nsp / room, i.e. it's not just client-side filtering
The differences:

namespaces are connected to by the client using io.connect(urlAndNsp) (the client will be added to that namespace only if it already exists on the server)
rooms can be joined only on the server side (although creating an API on the server side to enable clients to join is straightforward)
namespaces can be authorization protected
authorization is not available with rooms, but custom authorization could be added to the aforementioned, easy-to-create API on the server, in case one is bent on using rooms
rooms are part of a namespace (defaulting to the 'global' namespace)
namespaces are always rooted in the global scope

## Socket.io Emit Cheatsheet

```io.on("connection", (socket) => {

  // basic emit
  socket.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in the current namespace except the sender
  socket.broadcast.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 except the sender
  socket.to("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 and/or room2 except the sender
  socket.to("room1").to("room2").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1
  io.in("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in namespace "myNamespace"
  io.of("myNamespace").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 in namespace "myNamespace"
  io.of("myNamespace").to("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to individual socketid (private message)
  io.to(socketId).emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients on this node (when using multiple nodes)
  io.local.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all connected clients
  io.emit(/* ... */);

  // WARNING: `socket.to(socket.id).emit()` will NOT work, as it will send to everyone in the room
  // named `socket.id` but the sender. Please use the classic `socket.emit()` instead.

  // with acknowledgement
  socket.emit("question", (answer) => {
    // ...
  });

  // without compression
  socket.compress(false).emit(/* ... */);

  // a message that might be dropped if the low-level transport is not writable
  socket.volatile.emit(/* ... */);

});
```
