## How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

once our wireframe is ready, we can start breaking it into components.
sence a component is anything that has its standalone meaning in the layout.
For example, a calculator has a screen and many buttons. The screen is a component as it has its separate use of just displaying the calculations. An individual button is also a component. And finally, the whole calculator can be considered as a root component as it integrates the screen and the button components together.

## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
-does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
-Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.


## How can you identify where state needs to live?
Either the common owner (like app.js in our labs ) or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
