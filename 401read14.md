# What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

# How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
When the HTTP request comes in, the web server sends a message through The back-end picks it up at some point in the future. Meanwhile, the web server sends a response back through the HTTP request saying something is happening and the user will be notified later.
# What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?


The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events". The stream nomenclature alludes to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events from the subject/stream-source. This pattern then perfectly suits any process where data arrives from some input that is not available to the CPU at startup, but instead arrives "at random" (HTTP requests, GPIO data, user input from keyboard/mouse/..., distributed databases and blockchains, ...). Most modern programming-languages comprise built-in "event" constructs implementing the observer-pattern components

# How do you test an event driven system?

his is a guest post by Bob Reselman. Last updated July 2021.

Event-driven application architectures make it so that various components in a very large distributed system can communicate and interoperate asynchronously. Event-driven architectures are the glue that binds the various services and components that make up the system together.

Passing messages between components using a common message broker such as Kafka or RabbitMQ makes it possible for components to operate independently at scale. It’s not unusual for systems that support an event-driven architecture to process more than 20,000 messages a second.



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


### FIFO Queue


IFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. Examples of situations where you might use FIFO queues include the following:

To make sure that user-entered commands are run in the right order.

To display the correct product price by sending price modifications in the right order.

To prevent a student from enrolling in a course before registering for an account.



### Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub, which stands for Publisher/Subscriber, allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds.

Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. It is equally effective as messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks.

### AWS SNS and SQS

AWS SNS is a publisher subscriber network, where subscribers can subscribe to topics and will receive messages whenever a publisher publishes to that topic. AWS SQS is a queue service, which stores messages in a queue.
