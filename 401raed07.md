# Bearer Authorization
## Write the following steps in the correct order:
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret



Make a request to the access token endpoint


Receive access token


Receive authorization code


Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party


Make a request to a third-party API endpoint


Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

## What can you do with an authorization code?
authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.
## What can you do with an access token?
pplications use to make API requests on behalf of a user
## What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password.


### Client ID
The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it's public, it's best that it isn't guessable by third parties, 
### Client Secret
A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. 
### Authentication Endpoint
The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out,

### API Endpoint
an API endpoint is a point at which an API -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program. APIs work by sending requests for information from a web application or web server and receiving a response.
### Authorization Code
The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.
### Access Token
An access token is a tiny piece of code that contains a large amount of data. Information about the user, permissions, groups, and timeframes is embedded within one token that passes from a server to a user's device. 


## JWTs Explained
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. ... JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## Intro to JWT
Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.



## Are JWTs Secure?

The general opinion is that they're good for being used as ID Tokens or Access Tokens and that they're secure - as the tokens are usually signed or even encrypted.
