## React 

- What does .map() return?


an array of the same length of mapped array
If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
open a curly bractes then map the array returens the JSX and and equal the the new array to the original array
exmaple:


{props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}











- Each list item needs a unique ____.


a key like :

key={post.id}


form the previos example 



- What is the purpose of a key?  

The key property is used internally by React to more effeciently display, and manage lists of components. while it doesnt break the site  it's best practice to attach a key 






## The Spread Operator
What is the spread operator?


Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array. Syntax of Spread operator is same as Rest parameter but it works completely opposite of it.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Concat
- Expand
- Math
- combine two objects into one



Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.








// normal array concat() method
let arr = [1,2,3];
let arr2 = [4,5];

arr = arr.concat(arr2);

console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]








// spread operator doing the concat job
let arr = [1,2,3];
let arr2 = [4,5];

arr = [...arr,...arr2];
console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]







Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.


// expand using spread operator

let arr = ['a','b'];
let arr2 = [...arr,'c','d'];

console.log(arr2); // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]








Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const user1 = {
	name: 'Jen',
	age: 22,
};

const user2 = {
	name: "Andrew",
	location: "Philadelphia"
};

const mergedUsers = {...user1, ...user2};
console.log(mergedUsers)






 what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?


import the components


In your own words, what does the increment function do?

adds 1 to each item 




How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?


- create a child component and put the below code inside that component.
- import the child component to our parent component
 - inside the parent function create another function to run our desire event and pass the child component to return.



How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?



In order to execute a function from a child component, you will need to use Refs. React supports a special attribute that you can attach to any component, that's the ref attribute, it takes a callback function, and you can access the functions of the child component in the parent accessing this.refs.REF_NAME.METHOD_NAME.
