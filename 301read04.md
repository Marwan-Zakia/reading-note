### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?


We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”


### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.




 when the goal is for a better user expireance then 
we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them but that might take a long time to do to have it bug proof 



### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?



through Forms

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explainedan why we use a ternary operator?

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a **shortcut** for the if statement.






============
#### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:






===========




  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }










condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse


==============



**x===y?   true: false**
