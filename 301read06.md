## What is node.js?

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.


## In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

V8 is JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code, it was to execute either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.
