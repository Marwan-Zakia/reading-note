# **Growth mindset** 
------------

A growth mindset is a way of thinking that made all successful people achieve their goals by putting in the hard work and time. without it, we keep ourselves in a **fixed** mindset that keeps holding selves back and blaming our problems on others. 


--- 
Having this mindset keeps us striving and persevering to get to what we want knowing it's going to be :

- ***Challenging*** because if it was easy we would not be as technologically advanced as we are which requires the **Effort** that metaphorically shakes us  until the best comes out.
- *To be like the best you need to take criticism like the best* that's why we need to take as much feedback as we can even if it's on the harsher side to improve us or to see the perspective of others.
