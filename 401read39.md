The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app. However, you will not use the results of the API call directly in that component - it needs to be handled with a reducer that puts it into your app store. This will require you to use some sort of a thunk middleware to handle the asynchronous action. Then you will use mapStateToProps to simply pass it down to the component that renders the data.
# When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
state transitions involving a request to a Web server or the use of a timer? How do we integrate our application state with the data generated by an asynchronous action, 
# Document the following Vocabulary Terms
* middleware

Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. ... Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

* thunk

 a thunk is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to delay a calculation until its result is needed, or to insert operations at the beginning or end of the other subroutine.

* Alternative State Managers
RXJS Subjects: in some other cases, specially on low and medium complexity applications in Angular, we can choose to use the Subjects to handle the data and to pass the information to our components in a more general way.

Redux: recommended for medium and big applications, it is the generic solution for any library/framework which we may be using in the frontend.

AKITA: it is similar to Redux, but easier to use by avoiding us actions and dispatchers.

Mobx: it has similar functionalities to Redux, but again easier to use. It is recommended for small projects using React or Vue.
