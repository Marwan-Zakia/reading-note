# Describe “The Cloud”
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
# What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
# What is auto-scaling?
Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm
# What is bandwidth?
bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.
# How do cloud providers compute service costs?
When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

# Server Instances
A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.


# Cloud Architecture
Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.
# AWS
Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
# EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
Heroku probably has the edge on ease-of-use. That is really one of the main advantages of Heroku.

As for pricing - AWS will probably be cheaper, at least long-term and at scale. Remember that Heroku itself is deployed on AWS.

With regards to performance, I wouldn't expect a significant difference, at least if you have your Heroku and AWS apps set up for an "apples to apples" comparison. That really boils down to pricing. But if you are paying for similar computing resources on Heroku and AWS, I wouldn't expect there to be a significant performance difference.
 
# AWS S3
Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce networ
# AWS Lambda Basics & Lambda Functions

Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.


You organize your code into Lambda functions. Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there is no charge when your code is not running.

You can invoke your Lambda functions using the Lambda API, or Lambda can run your functions in response to events from other AWS services. For example, you can use Lambda to:

Build data-processing triggers for AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

Process streaming data stored in Amazon Kinesis.

Create your own backend that operates at AWS scale, performance, and security.

# CDN
A content delivery network, or content distribution network, is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.
