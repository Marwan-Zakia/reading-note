# do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
no using with react we use router change components that will appear or renedred as saprete html pages

# If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

* Inside the <BrowserRouter />
* Inside a <Route />




* What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
Routing is the ability to move between different parts of an application when a user enters a URL or clicks an element (link, button, icon, image etc) within the application.
Up until this point, you have dealt with simple projects that do not require transitioning from one view to another, thus, you are yet to interact with Routing in React.

* What does props.children contain?
this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

A simple example:

Here’s an example of a stateless function that is used to create a component. Again, since this is a function, there is no this keyword so just use props.children

``const Picture = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.src}/>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )
}``
* How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
The difference between forceUpdate() and setState() is te setState() re-render the component if some state or props of that component is changed. When we call setState() the lifecycle method shouldComponentUpdate() method calls automatically that decide if the component should re-render or not. The shouldComponentUpdate() method exit the update life cycle if there is no reason for re-render.

Whereas the forceUpdate() method re-render the component without even changing the state or props. When we call forceUpdate(), it will re-render the component and skip shouldComponentUpdate() method.
# Document the following Vocabulary Terms


* Mounting and Un-Mounting
  "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).

* effects hook

 when component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.
