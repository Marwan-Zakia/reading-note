## Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
The map method basicly goes through an Array [] and returns a new Array and includes the new changes  

## Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
The reduce method has two parameters which are usally (acc,val) goes through an Array [] in our case acc is the accumulator to explain it better way we have an array like this  [1,2,3] in the first step the accumulator is 1 then in the next step its 2 then 5.
and the val parameter is the current value of the step and reduce method usally returns a single value.
## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result With normal Promise .then() syntax
we first need to import superagent

const superagent = require('superagent');
const url = 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1'
superagent.get(url)
  .then( data => {
console.log(data);
  })
  
  .catch(err => console.error(err));









## Again with async / await syntax

async function getlocation(city) {

  let url = `https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`
  let results = await superagent.get(url);
    console.log(results.body);
}


## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
As you Know JS is excutes line by line so a promise is you asking for time while the code is fetching the results

The promise constructor takes in one argument: a callback function with two parameters — resolve and reject. This promise can then be used like this:
promise.then(function(result) {
  console.log("Promise worked");
}, function(err) {
  console.log("Something broke");
});
If promise was successful, a resolve will happen and the console will log Promise worked, 
otherwise something broke. That state between resolve and reject where a response hasn’t been received is pending state. 
* there are 3 states to a promise:
pending: awaiting promise response
resolve : promise has successfully returned
reject: failure occurred




## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous.For example there's forEach in Array. It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.

This can be used among other things to calculate total value from a property of each item.

  let totalSize = 0;
  items.forEach((item) => {
    totalSize += item.size;
  });
  return totalSize;
Calling the argument function is performed as part of normal step-by-step sequential execution of statements that make up the forEach implementation. Throwing an exception in the argument function would reveal a stack trace containing forEach and your function nested inside it.

It is very important to forEach to operate this way. If the argument function would be called asynchronously, code like in the example would not work as expected. The results would be zero each time.

Asynchronous function needs to perform an asynchronous operation
For a function to be asynchronous it needs to perform an asynchronous operation. It needs to incorporate the argument callback in handling the results of this asynchronous operation. Only this way the function becomes asynchronous.

For example a function reading contents of a file with the correct encoding can be implemented as an asynchronous function.
