# Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
An API Gateway is “middleware” that makes available backend services to mobile, web and other external clients via a set of protocols and commonly through a set of RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs). An API Gateway makes it much simpler to develop, secure, manage, and scale endpoints by moving most of the required logic from the client, into the gateway.
# List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
Amazon Relational Database Service or Amazon RDS is a managed cloud database service from AWS. It is a service designed to simplify the creation, operation, management, and scaling of a relational database for use as an application backend. AWS launched the RDS service initially in October 2009 with support for MySQL. As years went on, the RDS service added managed services for various other databases like SQL Server, Oracle database, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.


# What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.




# Serverless API

Easily define your applications as functions and events.
Declare AWS Lambda functions and their triggers through simple abstract syntax in YAML.

Deploy infrastructure and code with a single command.
AWS Lambda functions, triggers & code will be deployed and wired together in the cloud, automatically.

Extend your use-cases and workflow with Plugins.
Install thousands of Serverless Framework Plugins to build new serverless use-cases on AWS and integrate with other tools.
# Triggers
A trauma trigger is a psychological stimulus that prompts involuntary recall of a previous traumatic experience. The stimulus itself need not be frightening or traumatic and may be only indirectly or superficially reminiscent of an earlier traumatic incident, such as a scent or a piece of clothing. 
# Dynamo vs Mongo

Both these databases support multi-document transactions, but with key differences: MongoDB supports read and writes to the same documents and fields in a single database transaction. DynamoDB lacks support for multiple operations within a single transaction


# SQS and SNS Basics
There are two main communication paradigms in event-driven architectures used in microservices design. 
Queueing provides a messaging system to integrate two different services.
Publish/subscribe messaging is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in microservices architectures. In contrast to queueing, publish/subscribe messaging allows multiple consumers to receive each message in a topic. 
They allow us to de-couple producers and consumers of messages. By combining publish/subscribe messaging systems with queueing systems, we can build fault-tolerant, scalable, resilient, and reactive application architectures. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a number of services which provide these two communication paradigms. In this article, we will learn how to program AWS services – Simple Notification Service (SNS) for publish/subscribe messaging and Simple Queue Service (SQS) for queueing using AWS SDK in Java.
# AWS SQS vs SNS

AWS SNS is a publisher subscriber network, where subscribers can subscribe to topics and will receive messages whenever a publisher publishes to that topic. AWS SQS is a queue service, which stores messages in a queue
