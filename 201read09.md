 # debugging
 
  Is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. 

 To debug a program, user has to start with a problem, isolate the source code of the problem, and then fix it. A user of a progragrammer must know how to fix the problem as knowledge about problem analysis is expected. When the bug is fixed, 

Here’s the debugging process:

1. Reproduce the problem.

2. Describe the bug. Try to get as much input from the user to get the exact reason.

3. Capture the program snapshot when the bug appears. Try to get all the variable values and states of the program at that time.

4. Analyse the snapshot based on the state and action. Based on that try to find the cause of the bug.

5. Fix the existing bug, but also check that any new bug does not occur.
