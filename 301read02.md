## Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
in the diagram the render() starts first

## What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
mounting the data from the constructors  

## Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates?

constructor=> render  => React Updates =>componentDidMount => componentWillUnmount


## What does componentDidMount do?

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount()

 ## What types of things can you pass in the props?

 props enables us to pass variables from one to another component down the component tree. it can only a string variable. But props can be anything from integers over objects to arrays. Even React components.




## What is the big difference between props and state?
props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function)





## When do we re-render our application?
In some cases where the render() method depends on some other data. After the initial mounting of components, a re-render will occur when






## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
 knwoing that state can be read and write , whereas props are read-only. Once the state changes, the component renders again. In addition, state can be passed as props to child components too,also we can pass interactable things like the data from buttons or forms.
