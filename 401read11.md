# Node events
For the most recognizable example of Event-Driven Programming for people at any level of programming skill, we’ll turn to our old friend The Web Browser.

Every time you interact with a webpage through it’s user interface, an event is happening. When you click a button a click event is triggered. When you press a key a keydown event is triggered. These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way.

Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

## EventEmitter
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

Those are both worth checking out if your project needs to run faster than EventEmitter will allow. They are both built to allow for syntax that is almost identical to what we’ll use for EventEmitter so learning one will make it easy to work with all of them.

We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported we’ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.

const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;
 
Now we can get started with Event-Driven Programming in Node.

Imagine we’re creating a chat room. We want to alert everyone when a new user joins the chat room. We’ll need an event listener for a userJoined event. First, we’ll write a function that will act as our event listener, then we can use EventEmitters on method to set the listener.

const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const chatRoomEvents = new EventEmitter;

function userJoined(username){
  // Assuming we already have a function to alert all users.
  alertAllUsers('User ' + username + ' has joined the chat.');
}

// Run the userJoined function when a 'userJoined' event is triggered.
chatRoomEvents.on('userJoined', userJoined);
 
The next step would be to make sure that our chat room triggers a userJoined event whenever someone logs in so that our event handler is called. EventEmitter has an emit method that we we use to trigger the event. We would want to trigger this event from within a login function inside of our chatroom module.

function login(username){
  chatRoomEvents.emit('userJoined', username);
}
 
We could expand further by creating events for when a user logs out, when a message is sent, when a message is received, or any other event we could possibly need for our chat room to be as dynamic as we want it.
