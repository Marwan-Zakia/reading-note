# How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ( [] ) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn't depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

# Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
You could combine the loading state and data state into one state object and then you could do one setState call and there will only be one render.

# Is useState() synchronous?

useState and setState both are asynchronous.,They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* State Hook
useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
* Component Lifecycle
A component's lifecycle is broadly classified into four parts: initialization. mounting. updating, and. unmounting

* useReducer hook
If you've used useState() hook to manage non-trivial state like a list of items, where you need to add, update and remove items in the state, you might have noticed that the state management logic takes a good part of the component body.

That's a problem because the React component in nature should contain the logic that calculates the output. But the state management logic is a different concern that should be managed in a separate place. Otherwise, you get a mix of state management and rendering logic in one place, and that's difficult to read, maintain, and test!

To help you separate the concerns (rendering and state management) React provides the hook useReducer(). The hook does so by extracting the state management out of the component.
