# Solving Problems
To avoid problems we need to understand it first so read the problem completely twice or as many times as possible for us to understand it.
we also need to solve the problem manually with 3 sets of data samples and optimize the manual steps.
then we need to write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code then we replace said pseudo-code with real code step by step then we need to try to optimize the real code.

# Act like we make $1000/hr
The more serious and productive we make wer time the more we succeed that's why all successful people don't waste their time doing things that make other people impressed with what they own rather they work to fulfill their goals all the time with focus.

# How to think like a programmer

Problem solving is the meta-skill which will continue my first point  
Have a framework

1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because we don’t understand them .
How to know when we understand a problem? When we can explain it in plain English.
we start explaining it, and we instantly see holes in the logic we didn’t see before?
In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give our brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.


3.Divide
Do not try to solve one big problem.
Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means we know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
Once we solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

4.Stuck?
But what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”
First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.
Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!
The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

5.And Most importantly (Practice)
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If we want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!
Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before we recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”


# The 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem
If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on
Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. Ask the First "Why?"
Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.


4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

Tip:
Try to move quickly from one question to the next, so that you have the full picture before you jump to any conclusions.

* Know When to Stop
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.

If you identified more than one reason in Step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.

Tip 1:
The "5" in 5 Whys is really just a "rule of thumb ." In some cases, you may need to ask "Why?" a few more times before you get to the root of the problem.

In other cases, you may reach this point before you ask your fifth "Why?" If you do, make sure that you haven't stopped too soon, and that you're not simply accepting "knee-jerk" responses.

The important point is to stop asking "Why?" when you stop producing useful responses.


6. Address the Root Cause(s)
Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor Your Measures
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
