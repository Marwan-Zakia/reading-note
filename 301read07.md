## Who is Roy Fielding?
the pearson who crated the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol  
## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
because each machine has a different language
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
its an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests

## What does a GET do?
A method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).
## What does a POST do?
The POST method sends data to the server.
## What does PUT do?
A request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.
## What does PATCH do?
 is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused).
