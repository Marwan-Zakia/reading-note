## What is OAuth?

OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.

OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
The simplest example of OAuth in action is one website saying “hey, do you want to log into our website with other website’s login?” In this scenario, the only thing the first website – let’s refer to that website as the consumer – wants to know is that the user is the same user on both websites and has logged in successfully to the service provider – which is the site the user initially logged into, not the consumer.

## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

Step 1 – The User Shows Intent

Joe (User): “Hey, Bitly, I would like you to be able to post links directly to my Twitter stream.”
Bitly (Consumer): “Great! Let me go ask for permission.”
Step 2 – The Consumer Gets Permission

Bitly: “I have a user that would like me to post to his stream. Can I have a request token?”
Twitter (Service Provider): “Sure.  Here’s a token and a secret.”
The secret is used to prevent request forgery.  The consumer uses the secret to sign each request so that the service provider can verify it is actually coming from the consumer application.

Step 3 – The User Is Redirected to the Service Provider

Bitly: “OK, Joe.  I’m sending you over to Twitter so you can approve.  Take this token with you.”
Joe: “OK!”
*Bitly directs Joe to Twitter for authorization*

## What is OpenID?

OpenID is about authentication (ie. proving who you are), OAuth is about authorisation (ie. to grant access to functionality/data/etc.. without having to deal with the original authentication).

OAuth could be used in external partner sites to allow access to protected data without them having to re-authenticate a user.



## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

What is Authorization Code Flow?
Because regular web apps are server-side apps where the source code is not publicly exposed, they can use the Authorization Code Flow (defined in OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.1), which exchanges an Authorization Code for a token. Your app must be server-side because during this exchange, you must also pass along your application's Client Secret, which must always be kept secure, and you will have to store it in your client.

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users.

## What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
Implicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates. The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls

## What is Client Credentials Flow?
 use the Client Credentials Flow (defined in OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.4), in which they pass along their Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate themselves and get a token.

## What is Device Authorization Flow?
With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text

## What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow allows exchanging the username and password of a user for an access token and, optionally, a refresh token. This flow has significantly different security properties than the other OAuth flows. The primary difference is that the user’s password is accessible to the application.
