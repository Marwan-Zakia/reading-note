## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

TDM-based networks must transform into packet-based networks to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services. Packet

## UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself.


## Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

## Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

A connected socket is assigned to a new (dedicated) port, so it means that the number of concurrent connections is limited by the number of ports, unless multiple sockets can share the same port.

## Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
If you want to have a "peer-to-peer" type system, then you just have each client run both a client and a server socket - the server socket for accepting connections from other clients and the client socket for establishing connections to others.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms



- Listener
, also known as a network listener, is a listen socket that has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a port number, a server name, and a default virtual server. Each virtual server provides connections between the server and clients through one or more listeners.


- Event Handler
we can create event handler code that will run when an event fires

- Event Driven Programming

 a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events 


- Event Loop
the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.

- Event Queue

An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. 

- Call Stack

a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack




- Web Sockets

WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C


- Socket.io vs Web Sockets

It provides the Connection over TCP, while Socket.io is a library to abstract the WebSocket connections. WebSocket doesn't have fallback options, while Socket.io supports fallback. WebSocket is the technology, while Socket.io is a library for WebSockets.
