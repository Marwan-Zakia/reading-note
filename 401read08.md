# RBAC tutorial 

Role-based access control (RBAC) refers to the idea of assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization. It offers a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less prone to error than assigning permissions to users individually.

When using RBAC, you analyze the needs of your users and group them into roles based on common responsibilities. You then assign one or more roles to each user and one or more permissions to each role. The user-role and role-permissions relationships make it simple to perform user assignments since users no longer need to be managed individually, but instead have privileges that conform to the permissions assigned to their role(s).

For example, if you were using RBAC to control access for an HR application, you could give HR managers a role that allows them to update employee details, while other employees would be able to view only their own details.

When planning your access control strategy, it's best practice to assign users the fewest number of permissions that allow them to get their work done.

Benefits of RBAC
With RBAC, access management is easier as long as you adhere strictly to the role requirements. RBAC helps you:

create systematic, repeatable assignment of permissions

easily audit user privileges and correct identified issues

quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across APIs

cut down on the potential for error when assigning user permissions

integrate third-party users by giving them pre-defined roles

more effectively comply with regulatory and statutory requirements for confidentiality and privacy




# 5 steps to RBAC

- Inventory your systems. Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. ...

- Analyze your workforce and create roles. ...

- Assign people to roles. ...

- Never make one-off changes. ...

- Audit.


## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?


The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret 

The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by  Even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

## encryption
encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
## token
An authentication token securely transmits information about user identities between applications and websites. ... An authentication token allows internet users to access applications, services, websites, and application programming interfaces (APIs) without having to enter their login credentials each time they visit.
## bearer
The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by  Even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.
## secret
 A generic term for any secret value that an attacker could use to impersonate the subscriber in an authentication protocol. 
## JSON Web Token
JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.
