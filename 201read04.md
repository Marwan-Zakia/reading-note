# Images
imgaes can be multipule formats like JPEG , PNG , GIF 

PNG
is a lossless image format using **DEFLATE compression**. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk. This makes it unsuitable for storing or transferring high-resolution digital photographs but a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges.

GIFs
is a lossless image format that uses **LZW compression algorithm**. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing. GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations which can be cosidered as a 2 secened videos.


# Color
Color can really bring your pages to life.
The color property allows youto specify the color of text insidean element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

+ rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

+ hex codes 
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

+ color names 
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: black.

# Text
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
+ Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,and the size of the text)

+ Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

The formatting of your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are.
