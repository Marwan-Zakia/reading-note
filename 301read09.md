### What is functional programming?
Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions. These functions take input which is called as arguments then shows the output based on the inputs being taken which, given the same input always results in the same output.
#### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
Given the same input, always returns the same output. 
What are the benefits of a pure function?
#### Pure functions are more composable or modular
It is common in FP to combine many functions into a simple solution. You will often see Functional Programming code written as a chain of function calls. The pseudocode shown below represents a chain of function calls.
#### Pure functions are easy to test and refactor

#### What is immutability?
Given the same input, always returns the same output. 

#### What is Referential transparency?
you can replace the function with its value and get the same output.
You can construct a map with the function as the key and the value as another representative of the key, and you can be sure that the key-value pair always persist no matter what scenario.


#### Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

#### What is a module?
Node modules are the basic building block of the Node program.
The node module is a set of functions that can be reused in our application.

#### What does the word ‘require’ do?
importing data

#### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
unsing require
#### What do we have to do to make a module available?
export it
