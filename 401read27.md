# How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
So, we’ve looked at the three major ways React is different than plain JS. In particular, those were:

Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript.
React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.
Data for plain JS apps are stored in the DOM itself and has to be found from the DOM before it can be used. React apps store data in regular JavaScript variables
UI updates in plain JS have to happen by finding the DOM node to update and manually appending or removing elements. React automatically updates the UI based on setting and changing state within the component.
Is React Worth It?

# What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.

Functional Components

Class Components
A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.

* Children / Child Components
When designing React components, there are cases we want to change how the child components work, usually this is done by passing in different props. This may duplicate some common logic in different child component types. In this case, we can uplift the logic into a common place by using higher order components.
But sometimes, we can’t use HOC easily. For example when creating a React lib, to make it easy to use, we don’t want to force user to create something special, just let user pass in whatever they want. There are several other ways to do the uplifting.

* making sense of hooks
It’s rare for me to spend a day teaching or working in the shop without some poor soul asking me to explain the merits of this hook or that hook, and the reasoning behind why I might choose one brand or model over another. There’s good reason for this. Like tying thread (see my story “A Tangled Mess” in the Feb.-Mar. 2017 issue), hook sizing and nomenclature seem almost purposefully confusing, so let me give my best shot at clearing up some of that confusion.

* the state hook
It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.
* hooks api
When the user lands on our page, we want to call the API. In other words, we want to call the API during the mounting part of the component's lifecycle.

The API url to get a random advice we want to call is https://api.adviceslip.com/advice. Let's save it in a variable inside of the useEffect hook.

Create the asynchronous function
Then, let's create an asynchronous function to fetch our data. An asynchronous function is a function that needs to wait after the promise is resolved before continuing. In our case, the function will need to wait after the data is fetched (our promise) before continuing.
