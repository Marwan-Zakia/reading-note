This is the official style guide for writing Redux code. It lists our recommended patterns, best practices, and suggested approaches for writing Redux applications.

Both the Redux core library and most of the Redux documentation are unopinionated. There are many ways to use Redux, and much of the time there is no single "right" way to do things.

However, time and experience have shown that for some topics, certain approaches work better than others. In addition, many developers have asked us to provide official guidance to reduce decision fatigue.

With that in mind, we've put together this list of recommendations to help you avoid errors, bikeshedding, and anti-patterns. We also understand that team preferences vary and different projects have different requirements, so no style guide will fit all sizes. You are encouraged to follow these recommendations, but take the time to evaluate your own situation and decide if they fit your needs.

# Pro or Con Ã¢ multiple reducers can  when a commonly named action is dispatched

Well, it is a Pro more than a Con since we have to change multiple states in multiple components, the fact that all the reducers can listen when the action is dispatched can reduce a lot of work, each reducer can provide a different logic to the same dispatcher.


# Name a strategy for preventing the above
Make a reducer for each component that will be affected by the dispatcher, only effecting a specific amount of the state it self.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* store

Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows

* combined reducers
The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore .


* async actions

Async actions - React Async. Fetching data for display alone isn't sufficient for most applications. You'll often also want to submit data back to the server, or handle other types of asynchronous actions. To enable this, React Async has the concept of a deferFn .

* thunk middleware
Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action
