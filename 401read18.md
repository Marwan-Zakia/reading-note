# What are serverless functions?
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. "Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.
# If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
Building Lambda functions is great, but there can be some challenges during development. There are many that we may yet cover, but the one we wanted to start with was just writing and debugging the function. As such, we wanted to build a local harness for lambda functions that could shorten the feedback loop on development, be used for attaching debuggers, drive test data through the function, and profile it as well so we'd have an idea what it would cost to run.

To do this, we developed Emulambda. To be clear, that's a portmanteau of the words "emulator" and "lambda," but if you want to think it's some sort of anonymous emu, go for it! Emulambda, just like AWS Lambda, works with Python
# Describe how a CDN works
A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
