Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, local storage can only be read by the client-side. So the question is, in your app, who needs this data — the client or the server?

If it's your client (your JavaScript), then by all means switch. You're wasting bandwidth by sending all the data in each HTTP header.

If it's your server, local storage isn't so useful because you'd have to forward the data along somehow (with Ajax or hidden form fields or something). This might be okay if the server only needs a small subset of the total data for each request.

# Explain 3rd party cookies.
Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.

# How do pixel tags work?
A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. ... The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* cookies

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.
* authorization
Authorization is a process with which we can allow or restrict resources. Depending on the business logic, the requirement of user authorization can vary.

Let's take a CMS as an example. Blog readers can read content without authentication. To create a post in the blog, a user will have to sign up as an author. To publish a post, the user must have editor privileges. To make site-wide changes he must have Administrator privileges.

In this example, user authentication is not required to read a post but it's required to publish one.
* access control
 access control is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization
* conditional rendering
In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
