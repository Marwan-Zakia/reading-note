# Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
 the useState hook. Itâ€™s there to update state in React function components by offering to set the initial state and returning the actual state and an updater function


  the useReducer hook can be used to update state as well, but it happens in a more sophisticated way with a given reducer function and an initial state which returns the actual state and a dispatch function to alter the state in an implicit way by mapping actions to state transitions

# Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
This is mainly to have an extra option for sharing state and logic between components. ... Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix 'use', that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components.

# What do custom hooks usually do?
Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.

# Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
auth Context and formHandeler which allows us to take the value form the inputs with a function that can be  used with all coponents  



# Document the following Vocabulary Terms


* reducer
used useState() hook to manage non-trivial state like a list of items, where you need to add, update and remove items in the state, you might have noticed that the state management logic takes a good part of the component body.
* context api

With React context Hooks, you got a great way of tapping into context The useContext() 
This is way more straight-forward and definitely easier to read. AND you can use context in your entire function body now, not just in your JSX code!

* hooks and context example


```import React, { useContext } from 'react' // highlight-line
import ThemeContext from './theme-context'

const Person = props => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext) // highlight-line
  return <p className={context.isLight ? 'light' : 'dark'}>...</p>```
