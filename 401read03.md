### Document the following Vocabulary Terms


* Middleware
 
 is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue"

* Request Object

The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.

* Response Object

The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request object.


* Routing Middleware

Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.


* Test Driven Development

Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.



* Behavioral Testing


Behavioural Testing is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.
