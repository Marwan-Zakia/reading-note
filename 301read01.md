# component

React js is a component library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces(They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.)  In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props which i will talk about.


Components come in two types:


Class components  



Function components


## Characteristics of Components
Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


# Props

Is the way for data passes between components.

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

## Characteristics of Props
Props returns back an object
Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)
Props data is immutable (read-only)
