## Why is the Context API useful?
The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.
## Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
To access a React context outside of the render function, we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext

## What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
Theming — Pass down app theme.
i18n — Pass down translation messages.
Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user.

## Describe “Context Hell”
Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* global state
The application state should only change when the user performs some action with the UI (or whenever data finishes fetching, but that's usually as a result of some earlier action).

* global context
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components
* consumer
 A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

* what is role based access control?
le-based access control or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control. 

* react-cookies component
When trying to persist data in React apps, there are generally two ways to go: localStorage or cookies. You will find a lot of information and debate about localStorage vs cookies. You will generally see posts concluding that you should use localStorage. That's not this post.

This post will walk you through the use of cookies, via react-cookies.
